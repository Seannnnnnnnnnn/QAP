abstract = {The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is one of the classical combinatorial optimization problems and is known for its diverse applications. In this paper, we suggest a genetic algorithm for the QAP and report its computational behavior. The genetic algorithm incorporates many greedy principles in its design and, hence, we refer to it as a greedy genetic algorithm. The ideas we incorporate in the greedy genetic algorithm include (i) generating the initial population using a randomized construction heuristic; (ii) new crossover schemes; (iii) a special purpose immigration scheme that promotes diversity; (iv) periodic local optimization of a subset of the population; (v) tournamenting among different populations; and (vi) an overall design that attempts to strike a balance between diversity and a bias towards fitter individuals. We test our algorithm on all the benchmark instances of QAPLIB, a well-known library of QAP instances. Out of the 132 total instances in QAPLIB of varied sizes, the greedy genetic algorithm obtained the best known solution for 103 instances, and for the remaining instances (except one) found solutions within 1% of the best known solutions.
Scope and purpose
Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are one of the most popular heuristic algorithms to solve optimization problems and is an extremely useful tool in an OR toolkit. For solving combinatorial optimization problems, GAs in their elementary forms are not competitive with other heuristic algorithms such as simulated annealing and tabu serach. In this paper, we have investigated the use of several possible enhancements to GAs and illustrated them using the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), one of the hardest nut in the field of combinatorial optimization. Most of our enhancements use some greedy criteria to improve the quality of individuals in the population. We found that the overall performance of the GA for the QAP improves by using greedy methods but not their overuse. Overuse of greedy methods adversely affects the diversity in the population. By striking a right balance between the greedy methods that improve the quality of the solution and the methods that promote diversity, we can obtain fairly effective heuristic algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems.}

    abstract = { In this paper a reformulation technique is presented that takes a given linear zero-one programming problem, converts it into a zero-one polynomial programming problem, and then relinearizes it into an extended linear program. It is shown that the strength of the resulting reformulation depends on the degree of the terms used to produce the polynomial program at the intermediate step of this method. In fact, as this degree varies from one up to the number of variables in the problem, a hierarchy of sharper representations is obtained with the final relaxation representing the convex hull of feasible solutions. The reformulation technique readily extends to produce a similar hierarchy of linear relaxations for zero-one polynomial programming problems. A characterization of the convex hull in the original variable space is also available through a projection process. The structure of this convex hull characterization (or its other relaxations) can be exploited to generate strong or facetial valid inequalities through appropriate surrogates in a computational framework. The surrogation process can also be used to study various classes of facets for different combinatorial optimization problems. Some examples are given to illustrate this point. }

The work of Padberg and Rijal (Location, Scheduling, Design and Integer Programming, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 1996; Rijal, Ph.D. Thesis, New York University, 1995) has on the one hand yielded some basic facts about the associated quadratic assignment polytope, but has on the other hand shown that investigations even of the very basic questions (like the dimension, the affine hull, and the trivial facets) soon become extremely complicated. In this paper, we propose an isomorphic transformation of the “natural” realization of the quadratic assignment polytope, which simplifies the polyhedral investigations enormously. We demonstrate this by giving short proofs of the basic results on the polytope that indicate that, exploiting the techniques developed in this paper, deeper polyhedral investigations of the QAP now become possible.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the quadratic assignment problems (QAPs). The benefit or cost resulting from an economic activity at some location is dependent on the locations of other facilities. To model such location problems, QAP is introduced. The objective assigns the plants to the possible sites such that the total cost of building and operating the plants becomes minimal. There are many application areas that are modeled by QAPs. The chapter surveys the theory and the solution procedures for QAPs and outlines the various exact and approximate solution methods. There is only one successful exact solution technique available that is based on matrix reductions and on the Gilmore–Lawler bounds. It is demonstrated that the trace form provides a very convenient tool to derive the theory of this method. There is also a second use of the trace formulation. This approach yields completely new competitive bounds for the symmetric case based on the eigenvalues of the underlying matrices. The eigenvalue related bounds give access to an optimal reduction procedure and also help to characterize QAPs that are almost linear. The chapter describes some preliminary numerical comparisons with the classical lower bounds.}

Although many heuristics and semi-enumerative procedures for QAP have been proposed, no dominant algorithm has emerged. In this paper, we describe a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to QAP. Genetic algorithms are a class of randomized parallel search heuristics which emulate biological natural selection on a population of feasible solutions. We present computational results which show that this GA approach finds solutions competitive with those of the best previously-known heuristics, and argue that genetic algorithms provide a particularly robust method for QAP and its more complex extensions.}

abstract = {Parallel genetic algorithms (GAs) are complex programs that are controlled by many parameters, which affect their search quality and their efficiency. The goal of this paper is to provide guidelines to choose those parameters rationally. The investigation centers on the sizing of populations, because previous studies show that there is a crucial relation between solution quality and population size. As a first step, the paper shows how to size a simple GA to reach a solution of a desired quality. The simple GA is then parallelized, and its execution time is optimized. The rest of the paper deals with parallel GAs with multiple populations. Two bounding cases of the migration rate and topology are analyzed, and the case that yields good speedups is optimized. Later, the models are specialized to consider sparse topologies and migration rates that are more likely to be used by practitioners. The paper also presents the additional advantages of combining multi- and single-population parallel GAs. The results of this work are simple models that practitioners may use to design efficient and competent parallel GAs.}
